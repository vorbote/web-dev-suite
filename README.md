This is a class library created with the concept of `RESTful` interface. The `ResponseResult<T>` in this library can 
standardize the content of your `JSON` response. Secondly, the library also encapsulates commonly used Web response 
codes, such as 200 (OK) for success, etc.

In this update, we have also added the `BizAssert` tool class that asserts the business. With this assertion tool, you 
can easily throw the `BizException` that can be converted into `ResponseResult`. This update also adds a `CorsFilter` 
which can be easily configured. During the development process, we can often encounter the problem of cross-domain 
request of the browser. Therefore, through this filter, response data will be added some response headers that allow 
browsers to pass cross-origin request checks.

> The library is now in **_ALPHA_** test, if you could want to help us to test, you could clone this library and use 
> **maven** or **gradle** to build it to your local repository. If you found any bugs or have any question while using 
> it, please do not hesitate to contact us by submitting an **issue** with the situation you met. If you are able to
> fix or improve that problem on your own, we are also welcome your **Pull Request**.
